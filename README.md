- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @UnkLegacy, it's short for UnknownLegacy.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software Engineering.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Pyton, Java/Maven, GitHub (Actions/Repo management), AutoHotKey, and basically anything else I can get my hands on.
- I was previously a software developer of 10.5 years using a properitary language.  Now a Software Engineer since 2021 in "real world" programming languages.  Currently mainly Java and Python.
