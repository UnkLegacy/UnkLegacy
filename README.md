- 👋 Hi, I’m @UnkLegacy, it's short for UnknownLegacy.
- 👀 I’m interested in Software Engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Pyton, Java/Maven, GitHub (Actions/Repo management), AutoHotKey, and basically anything else I can get my hands on.
- I was previously a software developer of 10.5 years using a properitary language.  Now a Software Engineer for the last year or so in "real world" programming languages.  Currently mainly Java.
